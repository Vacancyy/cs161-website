                Hi! I am Yipeng Song, and I go by Roger. I am a Graduate CS student with a focus on CS education and software engineering. I love watching sports and making new friends. I feel grateful to be enrolled in the CS 16X series for the last three years and have a chance to teach 161 last term. I wish I could help you to be a better programmer and a better person overall.

                Hi all! My name is Erick Branner and I am a second year Applied Computer Science student from Sherwood, Oregon. I am currently involved in undergraduate research related to machine understanding of music. Aside from CS, I enjoy photography -- I shoot mainly sports for The Daily Barometer, Oregon State University's student newspaper. I look forward to working with y'all!

                Hi all, Jesse Chick here. I graduated from Tualatin High School in 2016 and am currently a junior in the Honors College and computer science professional school. I am currently involved in two reseach projects which are aimed at applying machine learning to computer security systems. Feel free to ask me questions about this class, your Honors thesis, machine leanring/AI, the MECOP program--I will be starting my second internship this summer--or anything else which might come up. My favorite aspect of this job is getting to meet and work with a new crew of students every term so don't be a stranger!

            <p>Hi everyone, I'm Miguel Gaspar, and a junior in computer science (applied option) with a minor in business and entrepreneurship. I still remember when I took this class having no experience in coding at all. So, whether or not this is the first coding class you'll take, we, all TAs, are here for you to succeed! Please don't be afraid to ask questions! I'm looking forward to a great term!</p>

I'm also involved with ACM-W, a club supporting women in computing, and a part of the Grace Hopper Scholarship team, raising money to send OSU EECS students to the Grace Hopper Conference in October 2020. Feel free to shoot me an email if you ever have any questions; I'm excited to work with everyone this term!

            <p>Hello, I'm Lucas Pichette. I'm a 2018 graduate from Sam Barlow High School, currently a second-year at OSU, and I had very little programming experience going into my major as a computer scientist. My focus is in cyber security, but I'm a fan of almost anything computer science related. TAs and www.learncpp.com are what saved my rear in CS161 and CS162, I encourage the use of both of these resources!!</p>
