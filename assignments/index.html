	  <p><u>Good programming style</u>: Please read and follow the
	    <a style="color:#0000FF" href="../assignments/161_style_guideline.pdf">programming
	      style guidelines</a> for this class.</p>

	  <p>Part of your grade for each assignment depends on 
            having program and function headers, proper indentation, 
	    vertical whitespace between statements, good variable names, 
	    etc., as explained in the guidelines.</p>
	  
          <p><u>Grading</u>: Assignments 1-4 will be <u>graded by
	      demonstrating your work for 10 minutes with a
	      TA</u>. You are required to
	    <u>sign up and meet with a TA within two weeks of the due date</u> to demo.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><u>Tip:</u>  Pick an early slot before they are all taken!  
	    The earlier your demo, the sooner you get feedback, 
	    which will help you do even better on the next assignment.</li>
	    <li><u>Demo Outside 2 Weeks:</u> Assignments that are
          demonstrated later than the acceptable time period will be
          receive a 50 point deduction.  (Also, we cannot guarantee a
          late grading slot.)</li>
	    <li><u>Demo Late Assignments:</u> Late assignments must still
	  be demonstrated within the two-week demo period beginning
	  from the assignment's original due date.</li>
	    <li><u>Missing a Demo:</u> If you miss your scheduled demo
	  with a TA, you will receive a 10 point (one letter grade)
	  deduction to that assignment for each demo missed.</li>
	    <li><u>No demo:</u> If you do not demonstrate your
	  assignment, you will receive a 0.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>One of your goals during your demo is to obtain specific
	    feedback about your assignment in terms of its strengths
	    and ways it can be improved.  You can gain up to 
	    <u>5 points of extra credit</u> per assignment 
	    by submitting a description of any weaknesses and how
	    you would change your program to address them.  You
	    may want to take notes about these ideas during your
	    demo session.  Our aim is for you to get a real benefit 
	    from demonstrating your work and thinking carefully about
	    the feedback you receive.
