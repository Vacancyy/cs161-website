        <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>Lecture: Strongly Encouraged. In class extra credit exercises can only be made up with approved absences.</li>
            <li>Labs: Required. You must attend your registered lab section. Missed labs result in a zero score for the lab and cannot be changed without an excused 
			absence. A lab may be excused by emailing your TAs and instructor at <a href="mailto:cs161-ta@ENGR.ORST.EDU">cs161-ta@engr.orst.edu</a> BEFORE the end of 
			lab with the following pieces of information<br> 
			1) the subject line is"Missing 161 lab"<br>
			2) the lab you are missing<br>
			3) your excuse<br>
			4) your plan for making up the lab, which can be the other lab you plan to attend in the week or doing the lab on your own prior to the next lab.<br>
			A valid excuse includes, but not limited to, family emergency, injury, hospitalization, death, birth of a child, trauma, illness, or school-related (or 
			other approved) events. The TAs in the lab you are missing or instructor will verify the message is BEFORE the end of the lab and excuse, and we will or will not provide 
			consent to the absence.  All decisions made are final.</li>
            <li>If the instructor is late for a lecture or a TA is late for lab, please remain in the classroom for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>You must remain in the lab until your work is complete or until the lab period has ended, as well as <b>viewed/graded</b> by a lab TA.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Technology Requirements</h3>
		<ul class="none">
			<li>Laptops required in lab. Make sure they are fully charged as outlets are limited.</li>
			<li>Laptops are not welcome in lecture. If you must use a laptop, you are required to sit in the back rows of the class room. If there are extenuating circumstances that require the use of a laptop in class, arrangements need to be made with the instructor prior to attending lecture.</li>
			<li>Cell phones, tablets and other mobile devices should be silenced and away during lecture. Repeated use of a cell phone or tablet in lecture will result in you being excused from the lecture.</li>
		</ul>
        <h3>About My Courses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>BE PROACTIVE, don't be reactive!!!</li>
            <li>BE RESPECTFUL, no one is perfect. Programming is difficult, and everyone in the class comes with different skills. The brain is a muscle and needs a work out in this area.

        <h3>Grade Evaluation Scores for labs, assignments, and exams will be posted on Canvas as they are graded.</h3>
        <h4>Labs - 20%</h4>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>You are <b>required to bring a laptop to the lab</b>.</li>
			<li>There are 10 total labs in this course, i.e. one to be completed each lecture week.  Since Monday labs are cancelled in week 3, we will have a 
			take-home lab that you can complete on your own or go to a Tuesday-Friday lab.</li>
            <li>You MUST attend the lab in which you are registered, unless receiving permission PRIOR to missing the lab!!! (Read Attendance policy!)</li>
            <li>Some parts of the lab will be group work while others will be individual work. You can submit one copy for any portion of the lab that is group work.</li>
            <li>Labs are graded on a 10-point scale broken down into any combination of quiz questions, hand-written responses to conceptual questions, and hands-on coding.</li>
            <li>These labs are supposed to enhance the lectures using reflective reasoning and hands-on learning.</li>
            <li>If you attended a lab and did not finish, you can finish <b>up to 3 points of the lab</b> at home and bring it with you to the next week's lab for a grade. You must show your update from the previous lab within the first 15 minutes of the current lab to redeem points on the prior lab, otherwise the work is not accepted.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with a lab grade, <b>you must contact your TAs through EMAIL within ONE WEEK</b> of receiving your grade. After one week, you will not be able to dispute your grade.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Peer Reviews - 10%</h4>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>You will assess the quality of your peers' designs or programs each week on Peerceptiv. Read the instructions above under "Course Materials" to create an account.</li>
			<li>There are 9 total peer reviews to be completed over the course of this class. Assignment 1-5 will receive code reviews, and assignments 3-6 will receive design reviews.</li>
			<li>You will provide meaningful comments that will be judged by your peers on Peerceptive.</li>
			<li>Your peer review grade is a combination of doing your peer reviews, how accurate and helpful your reviews are, and how your peers rate the quality of your work.</li>
			<li>If you are not going to submit a design or program for an assignment, then you can confirm this in Peerceptiv and still participate in reviews. Do not 
			click this if you are submitting a program late because you are not allowed to submit an assignment after you have reviewed others!!!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Assignments - 30%</h4>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>There are 6 total assignments to be completed over the course of this class.  Assignments 1-2 will only include code, and assignments 3-6 will include a design and code.</li>
            <li>DO NOT expect answers to emails about assignments after 5pm on the day it is due.</li>
            <li>All assignments include designing or writing a computer program, and programming assignments MUST compile and execute on ENGR. </li>
            <li>Programming assignments that do not compile on ENGR will receive a grade of <b>zero on the implementation portion of the assignment without any exceptions. </li>
			<li>Assignments are to be turned in before Midnight (<strong>by 11:59pm) on Sunday night, otherwise the assignment is late.</li>
			<li>You will turn in your assignments using Peerceptiv. Read the instructions above under "Course Materials" to create an account</li>
			<li>Programs are evaluated on how well they solve the assigned problem (adherence to program specification), proper formatting/use of comments, and creativity. </li>
			<li>You start with 5 points extra credit on your assignment total. <b>You can use these points for turning in your coding portion of the assignment(s) late, and 
			each point is equal to one day</b>. You can use these extra credit points on one program or spread them out across programs.  Absolutely no designs are accepted 
			late, and failure to submit a design or program will affect your peer review grade.  A program will be accepted without penalty as long as it is submitted 
			prior to the number of extra credit points you have remaining. After using your 5 extra credit points, a late program will not be accepted, and a late design is never accepted. You turn in a late program to Peerceptiv just as you would normally.</li>
            <li>Assignments in this course are graded by demoing your work for 15 minutes with a TA. You are required to <b>meet with a TA</b> within two weeks of the due date to demo. You can schedule a demo with a TA on the <a href="../index.html">home page</a> in the far right column of the bottom table labeled "Grading Hours".</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="none">
            <li><b>Demo Outside 2 Weeks:</b> Assignments that are not demo'd within the acceptable time period will be subject to a 50 point deduction.</li>
            <li><b>Demo Late Assignments:</b> Late assignments must still be demoed within the two week demo period beginning from the assignment's due date.</li>
            <li><b>Missing a Demo:</b> If you miss your demo with a TA, you will receive a 10 point (one letter grade) deduction to that assignment for each demo missed.  If you need to reschedule a demo, remove your name from the poll before rescheduling.  If you need to <b>reschedule the day of your demo</b>, still remove your name from the poll and email your demo TA with subject <b>"CS 161 Cancel Demo"</b>.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with an assignment grade, <b>you must contact your TAs through EMAIL</b> within ONE WEEK of receiving your grade. After one week, you will not be able to dispute your grade.</li>
            <li>Remember to use your TAs because they are the ones who execute, read, and grade the assignments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Exams - 30%  (15% each exam)</h4>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>The are 2 total exams for this course.</li>
            <li>The exams are true/false and multiple-choice, and they will be given during lecture time.</li>
            <li>A student must notify the instructor BEFORE the exam to schedule a make-up.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Final Exam- 10%</h4>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>There will be a cumulative final exam.</li>
            <li>The final exam may include any combination of programming, written work, and explanation of existing code.</li>
            <li>A student must notify the instructor BEFORE the final to schedule a make-up.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Proficiency Demo <span style="color: red">(Ability to Keep a Passing Grade (C or above)!)</span></h4>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>You will take a pass/fail live proficiency coding demo during the lab in week 10.</li>
            <li>There will be a practice demo given in week 5 with material from the first half of the class. In the practice demo, you will be scored on a pass/almost/no-pass score to give you feedback on where you stand in the class.</li>
            <li>If you do not have a passing grade in the class (below C), then failing the proficiency demo cannot hurt your grade because you are not expected to be proficienct (C or above) in the class to move forward. However, if you have a passing grade in the class (C or above),then you are expected to pass the proficiency demo to keep your passing grade in the class, i.e. <b>you cannot receive higher than a C- without passing the proficiency demo.</b></li>
            <li>Do not freak out!!! If you have a passing grade for your assignments and YOU have been the one to do the work, then you should be able to pass the proficiency demo program.</li>
            <li>A student must notify the instructor BEFORE the final demo to schedule a make-up.</li>

        <h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>
        <p class="indent">I encourage students to work together and learn from one another on labs and assignments. However, I do expect you to turn in your OWN work for every assignment. Assignments are NOT paired-programming, and all assignments are checked for similarities with others in the class, prior class assignments, and work published online!!! Working with someone does not include copying someone else's work and changing a small amount of that work, such as variable names, comments, spacing, etc. During group assignments you and your partners may turn in one assignment per group with everyone's name attached. Working together is discouraged on exams and the final. At NO point should you copy work from the internet, and if you do copy material from an external resource, then you need to cite the resource and author(s). Paying someone to complete you work is unacceptable and will result in immediate referral to the university!!! Cheating and plagiarism are not taken lightly!</p>
        <p>You will receive a zero on your first abuse of these rules, and in the case of shared work, the student sharing the work and the student copying the work will both receive zeros. In addition, the academic dishonesty charge will be documented and sent to your school's dean and the <a href="http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty">Office of Student Conduct</a>. The bottom line is: Each student is expected to understand all aspects of the programs s/he submits for credit!!!</p>
        <p>Please, read the university dishonesty policy:</p><a href="http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty"> OAR 576-015-0020 (2) Academic or Scholarly Dishonesty</a>
        <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
        <p>"Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations."</p>
        <p>Students with documented disabilities who may need accommodations, who have any emergency medical information the instructor should be aware of, or who need special arrangements in the event of evacuation, should make an appointment with the instructor as early as possible, and no later than the first week of the term. Class materials will be made available in an accessible format upon request.</p>
